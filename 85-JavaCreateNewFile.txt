3 approach to create new java file:
 - File.createNewFile() : When we initialize FIle object, provide file name and then call createNewFile()
methods return TRUE if new file is created and FALSE if file exists (throws IOException when its not able
to create the file) //Thay vì dùng "/" để phân cách các thư mục thì nên dùng file.separator
 (System.getPropety("file.separator"))

 - FileOutputStream.write(byte[] b) :If you want to create a new file and at the same time write some 
data into it, you can use FileOutputStream write method

 - Java NIO Files.write() : We can use Java NIO Files class to create a new file and write some data
 into it. This is a good option because we don’t have to worry about closing IO resources.
